title: Produce C AST from semantic actions
desc: |-
  In addition to the generated parse tree, we want to yield an AST as defined
  in Cabs. This AST is being used in the C parser. Semantic actions can be
  copied from there.
  
  Doing this will allow us to leverage existing code from the C front-end.
