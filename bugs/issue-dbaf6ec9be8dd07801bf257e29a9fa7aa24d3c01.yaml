title: Rename module GlrOptions to Options
desc: |-
  Currently, ocamlbuild does not properly support multiple options.ml files in
  different directories, even when using -for-pack. We need to think about how
  to make this possible. It might become more necessary in the future. For now,
  having a glrOptions.ml is okay.

    Moved internal modules to priv/, which is not -I(ncluded), so we can have
    multiple Options modules in different libraries (packs).
